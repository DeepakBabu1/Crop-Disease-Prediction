** Paddy Disease Prediction **

#Overview

This project is a Paddy Disease Prediction System built using Streamlit, designed to help farmers and researchers detect diseases in paddy crops. The application uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify paddy leaf diseases based on uploaded images.

#Features

•	User-Friendly Interface: Simple web-based UI for uploading paddy leaf images.

•	Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes CNN for disease detection.

•	Real-Time Prediction: Instantly classifies diseases and provides insights.

•	Data Visualization: Displays disease trends using interactive charts.

•	Local Storage: Stores uploaded images and predictions locally.

•	Cloud Deployment: Easily deployable on Streamlit Cloud, AWS, or GCP.

#Tech Stack

•	Framework: Streamlit

•	Language: Python

•	Machine Learning: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras and TensorFlow

•	Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

•	Storage: Local storage for images and predictions

#Process

•	Data Collection: Gather paddy leaf images with labeled diseases.

•	Preprocessing: Resize images, normalize pixel values, and augment data if necessary.

•	Model Training: Train a CNN model using Keras and TensorFlow.

•	Model Evaluation: Test the model's accuracy using validation datasets.

•	Deployment: Integrate the trained model into a Streamlit application.

•	User Interaction: Users upload images, and the model predicts the disease.

•	Visualization: Display results and trends using interactive charts.

#Deployment

•	Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

•	Push your project to a GitHub repository.

•	Go to Streamlit Community Cloud.

•	Connect your repository and deploy.

#Usage

•	Upload a paddy leaf image.

•	The CNN model predicts the disease and displays results.

•	Provides the Confidence Score(How certain the model is about the prediction)

#Future Enhancements

•	Improve model accuracy with more training data.

•	Add multilingual support for farmers in different regions.

•	Integrate real-time data from IoT devices.
